# Riddles ü§î
This is one of my solo websites (though it's really just a webpage). I've built this page from scratch. This website was made as a school project. I've primarily focussed on the functioning aspect of the page instead of the visual aspect and I continuously add small modifications to make it more easier for the user to use the page. 

### The Concept ‚Åâ
Well, it's pretty straight forward, the page gives you a riddle, you answer the riddle and the page will tell you if you're right or you're wrong. 

### Languages üñ•Ô∏è
This is the first project where I focussed more on the functioning of the website and thus more of JavaScript coding can be seen over HTML and CSS, though all three languages were used in this webpage.
